    "text": "Background of the presentation\nThis presentation was designed for a weekly student seminar series at the LBBE laboratory, organised by the Student Seminar team (most members of which are part of Les Pinsons Migrateurs). It originates from discussions with many of my fellow colleagues about reproducible research—its whys and hows—and from the observation that a seminar on this topic has strong potential to spark rich and meaningful discussions.\nThis seminar is a fusion of two earlier contributions: my very first hands-on workshop held in February 2025 for the LIEC (Metz), and a previous presentation given in September 2025 for the LEHNA (Lyon). You can explore the full materials and corresponding websites here: workshop and presentation.\nRecognising the ongoing need to share knowledge about reproducible research—and the desire to discuss it with non-permanent researchers—I decided to organise this session as a way to contribute what I know on the topic (or what I think I know 👽). While I don’t claim to be an expert, every little helps. My hope is that this seminar sparks enough interest to encourage others to explore and strive toward more reproducible, transparent, and accessible research practices."

    "text": "Description\nThe presentation focuses on introducing the what, where, when, and how of reproducible research. We’ll explore the benefits of working reproducibly—both for others and for ourselves—examine the factors that limit or discourage reproducible practices, and discuss practical, incremental solutions for becoming more reproducible in our work. There will be some interactive elements scattered around the presentation. A seminar on this subject gains value through interaction and engagement from the audience, so I’ve woven discussion questions throughout the presentation to encourage exchange and reflection."
